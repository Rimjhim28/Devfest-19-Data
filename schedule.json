        "description": "Do APK or app size matters?\r\nDoes a user think about the APK size before downloading it?\r\nDoes a user think about space, an app occupying on the phone?\r\nIs your App size is more than just a few MBs?\r\n\r\nWhat if we provide very basic functionality and let the user decide whether he wants the advanced or additional functionality or not?\r\n\r\nYes, The user thinks about the app size before downloading or updating an app which has a size larger than a few MBs. The user thinks about the data also over which he will be downloading or updating that app. He or she even think about how much space will it take on his or her device. In this fight of space in the device and size of the app, the apps having a smaller size and frequent utility wins the battle. \r\n\r\nWhat if we provide very basic functionality and let the user decide whether he wants the advanced or additional functionality or not. What if he or she can download only the features he needs on demand and keep the app compact. \r\n\r\nGoogle new feature of dynamic delivery enables us to deliver the features on demand. This helps us to reduce the size of APK and even enables the user to choose what features he needs. From a developers perspective, this is very easy to implement and maintain.\r\n\r\nEven we (Sharechat) were also at the same state where the size of APK was an issue with the new set of features we were trying to implement. Google Dynamic delivery came to the rescue.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually a dynamic delivery?\r\nHow can we reduce the APK size with it?\r\nHow it can help a user?\r\nHow to implement it in Android?\r\nHow difficult is it to implement in the existing code base?\r\nHow will it look to the user in the app?\r\n\r\nWell, let's get all these questions answered in the talk along with our experiences and challenges we faced.",

        "title": "Let's Talk Composing UI",

        "description": "While Developing Apps, following a Reactive Architecture (for example MVI, Mobius, Redux and even MVVM) & Single Source of Truth can get you some big wins including but not limited to, Loose Coupling & Separation of Concerns, Code Testability and easy debugging, unidirectional data, etc. However, unlike Web, where Reactive Architectures are the norm, in Android, we need to opt for Reactive Architecture considering few tradeoffs (time to market, learning curve, etc.), as it’s not natural in Android.\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean by saying Reactive architecture is not natural in Android? Just like web frontends, Android apps revolve around the UI, everything we do in our Android apps has some direct or indirect relation with the UI, and the Android UI framework is imperative itself.\r\nWhile the Android Platform team kept adding more and more types of Views (such as Constraint Layout, RecyclerView or more recent Motion Layout), they didn’t change the nature of UI framework itself since the beginning of android development. This was majorly due to language and tooling limitations (limited by the technologies of that time).\r\n\r\nGoogle announced official support for Kotlin 2 years back, and now major numbers of professional Android Developers worldwide already adopted Kotlin, which made it easier for Google to go Kotlin first in this IO19. Kotlin comes with many perks, some of them are Functional Programming support, compiler plugin capabilities and most importantly huge support on building DSLs at ease.\r\n\r\nWhat relation does Koltin have with Reactive applications? In this IO19, Google announced Jetpack Compose (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/), a new (still-in-development) next generation, Kotlin based, reactive cum declarative UI toolkit, backed by principals like Single Source of Truth, Unidirectional Data Flow, Functional Programming (especially function composition and effects).\r\n\r\nThis new UI toolkit would require a radical shift in our thought process about app architectures UI programming. In this talk, we would see how we can create and interact with UI with Jetpack Compose and how different it is from the present Android framework. We will also look into examples of some code patterns and ideas of from a few famous platforms such as Vue.js, React, Flutters, etc., and how these patterns and are adopted in Jetpack Compose.\r\n",

In this talk, we will look at the new Work Manager announced at Google I/O 2018 to solve background processing. While, it is still in alpha we will look at what it has to offer and how to make the most of it. We will also look at some of the internal details of the Work Manager to better understand the magic under the hood and then look at some of the best ways to use it in your own app.",

        "description": "The advent of machine learning along with its integration with computer vision has enabled users to efficiently to develop image-based solutions for innumerable use cases. A machine learning model consists of an algorithm which draws some meaningful correlation between the data without being tightly coupled to a specific set of rules. It's crucial to explain the subtle nuances of the network along with the use-case we are trying to solve. With the advent of technology, the quality of the images has increased which in turn has increased the need for resources to process the images for building a model. The main question, however, is to discuss the need to develop lightweight models keeping the performance of the system intact.\r\nTo connect the dots, we will talk about the development of these applications specifically aimed to provide equally accurate results without using much of the resources. This is achieved by using image processing techniques along with optimizing the network architecture.\r\nThese applications will range from recognizing digits, alphabets which the user can 'draw' at runtime; developing state of the art facial recognition system; predicting hand emojis, developing a self-driving system, detecting Malaria and brain tumor, along with Google's project of 'Quick, Draw' of hand doodles.\r\nIn this presentation, we will discuss the development of such applications with minimization of CPU usage.",
